## Confidence & Limitations

**High confidence:**
- All URLs cited are from real, existing websites verified through search results
- Creator profiles are based on multiple corroborating sources
- Content categories and descriptions are accurate based on available information

**Medium confidence:**
- Some specific article URLs may have shifted since search results were compiled
- Subscriber counts and traffic figures may have changed

**Gaps:**
- Middle East coverage is thin (limited to Morocco, which straddles Africa/Middle East)
- Central Asia is underrepresented
- Pacific Islands coverage is minimal
- More local-language content (non-English) could fill gaps for specific destinations

**Recommendation:** Before using any URL in production, verify the link is still live and the content matches the description. Web content changes frequently.
