2. **Slow travel**: Depth over breadth, staying longer in fewer places
3. **Culinary-led trips**: Food as the primary reason to visit, not an afterthought
4. **Characterful stays**: Farm stays, converted buildings, and design hotels over chains
5. **Event-driven travel**: Solar eclipse in Spain, Route 66 centennial, Winter Olympics, Asian Games
6. **Responsible access**: Visiting emerging destinations before they become overcrowded
7. **Train over plane**: European rail renaissance driven by new routes and environmental awareness
