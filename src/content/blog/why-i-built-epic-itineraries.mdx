Every good trip starts the same way. You stumble across a blog post about a hidden beach. A YouTube video showing the best ramen street in Osaka. A friend's Instagram story from a market you've never heard of.

You save it somewhere. A note. A bookmark. A tab you promise yourself you'll come back to.

Then you save twenty more. And when it's finally time to plan, half of them are gone, the rest are scattered across six different apps, and you can't remember why you saved any of them.

## The Peru trip that started it all

Last summer, I was planning a family trip to Peru. I'd been collecting content for months — blog posts about Cusco, YouTube videos of the Sacred Valley, restaurant tips from food bloggers, Airbnb listings in Ollantaytambo.

The research was spread across browser bookmarks, a Google Doc of links, WhatsApp messages to my wife, and Instagram saves I couldn't find again. When it came time to actually plan the trip, I spent more time hunting for my research than using it.

I'm a product manager by trade. I build software for a living. And I couldn't find a tool that solved this specific problem — the messy, exciting, chaotic phase of travel research that happens *before* you're ready to plan.

## The gap in the market

There are plenty of travel planning tools. They want to help you build an itinerary, book hotels, map your route. But they all assume you've already done the research. They start at step three.

What about steps one and two? Finding great content and keeping it organised?

That's what Epic Itineraries does. It's a place to save the travel content you find online — articles, videos, hotel listings, restaurant reviews — and keep it all in one library, tagged and organised by trip.

And when you've collected enough, AI reads everything you've saved and structures it into a day-by-day itinerary. Not a generic one. Yours. Built from your research, your taste, your discoveries.

## What makes it different

The AI doesn't invent recommendations. It doesn't add restaurants you didn't find or attractions it thinks you should visit. Everything in your itinerary traces back to a real source — a blog post, a video, a guide written by someone who was actually there.

Content creators get credited. Always. The people who write the posts and make the videos that inspire your trip deserve to be visible in your plan, not erased by an algorithm.

## Where we are now

Epic Itineraries launched in January 2026. It's early days. The product is free, the team is small (just me), and there's a long list of features I want to build.

But the core loop works: save, organise, generate. And the problem it solves is real — I know because I lived it.

If you've ever lost a great travel recommendation in a sea of browser tabs, this is for you.
