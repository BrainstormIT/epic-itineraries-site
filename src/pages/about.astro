          <p>
            Every good trip starts the same way. You stumble across a blog post about a hidden
            beach. A YouTube video showing the best ramen street in Osaka. A friend&rsquo;s
            Instagram story from a market you&rsquo;ve never heard of.
          </p>
          <p>
            You save it somewhere. A note. A bookmark. A tab you promise yourself you&rsquo;ll
            come back to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then you save twenty more. And when it&rsquo;s finally time to plan, half of them are
            gone, the rest are scattered across six different apps, and you can&rsquo;t remember
            why you saved any of them.
          </p>
          <p class="text-foreground font-medium">
            That&rsquo;s not a planning problem. That&rsquo;s a research problem. And it&rsquo;s
            the reason Epic Itineraries exists.

    <!-- The idea -->

          The idea
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground animate-on-scroll">
          <p>
            Epic Itineraries started as a personal frustration. Our founder, Edwin, was planning a
            family trip to Peru and found himself drowning in saved links. Blog posts in one app,
            restaurant tips in another, YouTube guides bookmarked somewhere on his phone. Hours of
            research, and nothing that looked like a plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tools that existed either wanted to plan the trip for you &mdash; ignoring everything
            you&rsquo;d found yourself &mdash; or gave you a blank document and wished you luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            There had to be something in between. A place to save what you find, keep it organised,
            and when you&rsquo;re ready, turn it into an actual itinerary. Not a generic one.
            <em>Yours.</em> Built from your research, your taste, your discoveries.

    <!-- How we think about travel planning -->
    <section class="py-16 md:py-24">

          How we think about travel planning
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground animate-on-scroll">
          <p>
            We believe the best travel plans come from real research, not algorithms. The people who
            write detailed blog posts about their favourite neighbourhood in Lisbon, the vlogger who
            spent a month in Bali, the friend who always knows where to eat &mdash; their
            recommendations are worth more than anything an AI can dream up on its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            So our AI doesn&rsquo;t invent. It organises. It reads what you&rsquo;ve collected and
            structures it into a day-by-day plan. Every suggestion traces back to a real source.
            Every creator gets credited.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means your itinerary is as good as the research you put into it. And we think
            that&rsquo;s exactly how it should be.

              The AI works with what you&rsquo;ve saved. It never invents places, restaurants, or
