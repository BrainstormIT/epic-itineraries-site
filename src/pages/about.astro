          <p>
            Every good trip starts the same way. You stumble across a blog post about a hidden
            beach. A YouTube video showing the best ramen street in Osaka. A friend&rsquo;s
            Instagram story from a market you&rsquo;ve never heard of.
          </p>
          <p>
            You save it somewhere. A note. A bookmark. A tab you promise yourself you&rsquo;ll
            come back to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then you save twenty more. And when it&rsquo;s finally time to plan, half of them are
            gone, the rest are scattered across six different apps, and you can&rsquo;t remember
            why you saved any of them.
          </p>
          <p class="text-foreground font-medium">
            That&rsquo;s not a planning problem. That&rsquo;s a research problem. And it&rsquo;s
            the reason Epic Itineraries exists.

    <!-- The idea -->
    <section class="py-16 bg-brand-cream-dark">
      <div class="container max-w-3xl">
        <h2 class="font-serif text-3xl font-normal italic text-primary mb-8 animate-on-scroll">
          A decade in the making
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground animate-on-scroll">
          <p>
            This idea started more than a decade ago &mdash; two friends, some beers, and a shared
            enthusiasm for travel. We brainstormed a platform that could track, connect and
            discover. Maps, data, the works. Suggest itineraries. Surface patterns. Turn thoughts, 
            preferences and constraints into an itinerary that actually made sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem at the time? Every conversation made it bigger. Every session added another feature,
            another data source, another &ldquo;what if we also&hellip;&rdquo; Until it became the
            kind of project that&rsquo;s too big to start. So it sat there for years &mdash; a
            great <s>domain</s> idea that never got smaller than enormous.
          </p>
          <p>
            What changed since was the approach, not the ambition. Think big, start small, move fast.
            Most importantly, the first part of any trip &mdash; the research, the inspiration
            &mdash; still isn&rsquo;t done well by any app out there. <b>Ten years later, we still do
            research our way: searching online, following links, reading one good comment and
            checking if the author had more tips elsewhere.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, some of the sources are new &mdash; we get inspiration from Instagram that
            wasn&rsquo;t there at the time. Certainly the AI tools didn&rsquo;t exist. Yet with all
            these new capabilities, the grunt work that some people actually find fun is still
            there. And for good reason. It builds anticipation, expectation, excitement.
          </p>
          <p>
            We just need something to keep it all together. So that&rsquo;s what Epic Itineraries
            is today. We use it, and believe others may find it useful too. As we keep collecting,
            keep discovering, keep experiencing and experimenting, this little thing might actually
            grow. Plenty of ideas!

    <!-- How we think about travel planning -->

          How we think about travel planning
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-6 text-muted-foreground animate-on-scroll">
          <p>
            The best travel plans come from real people, not algorithms. The people who&rsquo;ve
            been there. Who had the experience. Those who write detailed blog posts about their
            favourite neighbourhood in Lisbon, the vlogger who spent a month in Bali, the friend
            who always knows where to eat &mdash; their recommendations are worth more than
            anything an AI can generate on its own.
          </p>
          <p>
            So our AI doesn&rsquo;t invent. It organises. It reads what you&rsquo;ve collected and
            structures it into a day-by-day plan. Every suggestion traces back to a real source.
            A source you added.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means your itinerary is as good as the research you put into it. And we think
            that&rsquo;s exactly how it should be.

            Epic Itineraries is built by Edwin van Leeuwen &mdash; the kind of traveller who reads
            every restaurant review, digs up the off-the-beaten-track spots, and treats the
            research phase as part of the adventure. His family and friends have learned to be
            patient.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you&rsquo;re the kind of person who spends hours digging up the best places to eat,
            the best activities to do, and the spots the guidebooks missed &mdash; this was built
            for you.
